Problem:

Analyze S&P 500 Index Price Data using statistical tests and forecast future returns using the ARIMA model.

Answer the following using your results:

1. According to the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test, are the returns stationary ?
2. Assuming that we only choose ARIMA models with p, d, q from 0 to 5, what is the optimal ARIMA order?
3. Using the given dataset, what is tomorrowâ€™s expected return?

Constraints:

Using S&P 500 Index Price Data, check for stationarity of returns using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test and find the optimal ARIMA order to forecast future returns. No other models should be used to analyse the data, and solutions using Python are preferred.
